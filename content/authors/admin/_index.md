Last thing first, I earned my PhD from the [School of Mathematics](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths-research-innovation) at the University of Leeds (UK) in 2021. In my [research](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/28836/), I was interested in analytical modelling of group behavior. Among my current interests are data science and mathematics communication. Not so long ago, I trained as a maths teacher and taught in school for two years.
