## For now, I am building this page as a random collection of things I learnt about Python.
&nbsp;  
 - An **if** cycle with the **elif** option.
```python
# Assign value six to the variable x
x = 6

# An if cycle
if x < 2 :
    print('tiny')
elif x < 10 :
    print('medium')
else :
    print('large')
```
